# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

- Download the dataset and loads them intol the Global Environment
- Merges the XTrain to XTest, YTrain to YTest, SubTrain to SubTest
- Merges activity name to main dataset
- Labels the main datasets columns
- Extracts only the mean and std
- Takes the average and reorders the data
- The end result is shown in the file tidy.csv (this is of the independent Tidy data set showing the averages)
